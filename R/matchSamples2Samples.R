## two patterns from different xset.msp that have the same annotation
## will be the same variable. However, for patterns without annotation
## similar relations can exist. We seek patterns in different files,
## eluting within a given time window with a given spectral
## similarity. 

## This function returns a list of two things: the first element is a
## msp object containing the pseudospectra that are found in multiple
## samples, and the second is an object like the one returned by
## matchSamples2DB, a nested list containing for each pattern in each
## sample either nothing or the index of the spectrum as it is found
## in the DB. 

## For larger data sets, the corresponding yes-no matrix will be way
## too large (the 2007 grape metabolome leads to a 36734x36734
## matrix), but it is very sparse. If argument annotations equals
## NULL, this function will only return the spectra that are found in
## several patterns and not the annotations.

## Note that from July 30 2013 on, xset.work.orig contains SCALED spectra,
## and xset.msp unscaled spectra!

## Aug 13: new structure of annotations, now a three-column data.frame

## Dec 19: addition of RI check, as an alternative to rt check
